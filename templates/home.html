      <h5>
        As a data science student (MSc) and Electronic Prescrbing and Medicines Administration (EPMA) Pharmacist,
        my professional interests lie within health data. <br> <br>

        Electronic health records (EHR) systems, such as those I work with, generate and store vast quantities
        of patient data.
        Such data includes but is not limited to diagnoses, observations,
        lab results, measurements, patient demographics and prescribed medication.
        Spurred by the impactful use of predictive analytics during the COVID-19 pandemic, I embarked on my journey
        into
        data science to learn how to extract valuable insights from such data.
