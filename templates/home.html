          <h4> <br>As a Data Science student (MSc) and Electronic Prescrbing and Medicines Administration (EPMA) Pharmacist,
             my interests lie in the intersection of data and health. <br> <br>
            Knowledge of the vast and ever increasing volume of data within electronic health record systems lead to my pursuit
            of data science skills. Now, I wish to use these skills to extract actionable insights and build the tools of the future.
