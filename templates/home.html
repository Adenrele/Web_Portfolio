    As a data science student (MSc) and Electronic Prescrbing and Medicines Administration (EPMA) Pharmacist,
    my professional interests lie within health data. <br> <br>

    Electronic health records (EHR) systems, such as those I work with, generate and store vast quantities
    of patient data.
    Such data includes but is not limited to diagnoses, observations,
    lab results, measurements, patient demographics and prescribed medication.
    Spurred by the impactful use of predictive analytics during the COVID-19 pandemic, I embarked on my journey into
    data science to learn how to extract valuable insights from such data.
    My journey began with SQL and led me through statistics, Python, machine learning and
    more.

    This website was built using Python (Flask) and deployed to a Heroku server using Git.
    I also learnt rudimentary HTML and CSS in the process.
