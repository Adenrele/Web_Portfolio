    As a data science student (MSc) and Electronic Prescrbing and Medicines Administration (EPMA) Pharmacist,
    my professional interests lie within health data. <br> <br>

    Electronic health records (EHR) systems, such as those that I work with, generate and store vast quantities
    of patient data that was
    <a href="https://www.health.org.uk/publications/reports/untapped-potential-investing-in-health-and-care-data-analytics"
      target="_blank" class="w3-hover-text-green"> typically underutilised within the NHS</a>.
    Such data includes but is not limited to diagnoses, observations,
    lab results, measurements, patient demographics and prescribed medication.

    <br><br>
    Spurred by the impactful use of predictive analytics during the COVID-19 pandemic, I embarked on my journey into
    data science.
    Begining with SQL, improving my understanding of statistics, learning Python, delving into machine learning and
    more.
    Now, I wish to use my skills to extract actionable insights from health datasets in professional environments.
