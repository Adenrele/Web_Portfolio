          <h4> <br>As a data science student (MSc) and Electronic Prescrbing and Medicines Administration (EPMA) Pharmacist,
             my interests lie in the intersection of data and health. <br> <br>
            Experience in the implementation of EPMA systems and understanding of the vast and ever increasing volumes of data within 
            electronic health record systems lead to my pursuit of data science skills. 
            Now, I wish to use my skills to extract actionable insights and build the data tools of the future.
